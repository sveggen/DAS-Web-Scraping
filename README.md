# DAS-Web-Scraping

The repository contains examples of the following two common libraries used for Web Scraping:
* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
  * [beautifulsoup.ipynb](beautifulsoup.ipynb) retrieves, saves and outputs all "book" div's from a static website.
* [Selenium with Python](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
  * [selenium.ipynb](selenium.ipynb) retrieves, saves and outputs a table generated with Angular.js in browser mode.
  * [selenium_headless.ipynb](selenium_headless.ipynb) retrieves, saves and outputs a table generated with Angular.js in headless mode.

Note: For the Selenium examples the chromedriver can be installed [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), and has to be the same version as your Google Chrome/Chromium distribution.
